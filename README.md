Cartographer
------------

##Introduction
Cartographer is a stand-alone program used to procedurally generate tile-based maps for 2D games.
Initial work is focused around Pokemon-style maps where there is a limited number of clear paths
through an area with well-defined entry and exit points. The user will be able to compose maps
together, choosing from a series of permutations, in order to make larger and more varied areas.
The user will also be able to indicate that maps should have certain features, such as entrances 
to buildings, caves, or other maps. 

##Project Status
Cartographer is currently undergoing initial development, there is no stable release suitable for
public consumption.
